<h1>The full legal bit</h1>

When we mention Girl Show, we mean this applications.</p>

<p>There are some rules about what is acceptable though, so when you are using Girl Show you may not post, send or upload any Content which:</p>

<ol><li>contains expletives or language which could be deemed offensive or is likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person;</li><li>is obscene, pornographic or otherwise may offend human dignity;</li><li>is abusive, insulting or threatening, or which promotes, depicts or encourages violence, self-harm, suicide, racism, sexism, hatred or Girltry;</li><li>encourages any illegal activity including, without limitation, terrorism, inciting racial hatred or the submission of which in itself constitutes committing a criminal offence;</li><li>is defamatory;</li><li>relates to commercial activities (including, without limitation, sales, competitions and advertising, links to other websites or premium line telephone numbers);</li><li>involves the transmission of "junk" mail or "spam";</li><li>impersonates a person, company or brand with the intent to deceive or confuse others;</li><li>contains any spyware, adware, viruses, corrupt files, worm programmes or other malicious code designed to interrupt, damage or limit the functionality of or disrupt any software, hardware, telecommunications, networks, servers or other equipment, Trojan horse or any other material designed to damage, interfere with, wrongly intercept or expropriate any data or personal data whether from Girl Show or otherwise;</li><li>itself, or the posting of which, infringes any third party's rights (including, without limitation, intellectual property rights and privacy rights);</li><li>shows another person where such Content was created or distributed without that person's knowledge, and without that person having been afforded an opportunity to refuse such creation or distribution; or</li><li>contains images of children, even if you are also in the photo, or endangers minors.</li></ol>

We may remove any Content you submit to Girl Show if we believe it violates the Terms or we are required to do so by applicable law.</p>

<h3>Are there any rules relating to personal data like my email address?</h3>

<p>You may not display any personal contact or banking information on your individual profile page ("Profile") whether in relation to you or any other person (for example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other banking details, or place of work). If you do choose to reveal any personal data about yourself to other users, whether via email or otherwise, it is at your own risk. We encourage you to use the same caution in disclosing details about yourself to third parties online as you would under any other circumstances. You are required to follow our Guidelines and Safety Tips when doing so.</p>

<h3>Who can see the Content that I put on Girl Show?</h3>

<p>When you upload Content to Girl Show it can be accessed and viewed by the general public. If you do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you can opt to use the private folders and select the person to whom you wish to give access. If you still do not want such Content to be viewed by others, then you should not upload it to Girl Show. We reserve the right (without obligation) at our sole discretion and without giving you notice, to remove or edit, limit or block access to any Content that you upload or submit to Girl Show without any incurring liability to you. We have no obligation to display any Content that you submit to Girl Show, nor to check the accuracy or truthfulness of any Content submitted to Girl Show, nor to monitor your use or the use of other users of Girl Show.</p>
